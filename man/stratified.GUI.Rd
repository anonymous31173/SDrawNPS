\usage{
stratified.GUI()
}
\value{
Nothing is returned by the function.  The sample object will be
  stored in the current workspace, and any export files will be on the hard
  drive. Any maps drawn during the life of the dialog will remain in R after
  the dialog closes. These graphs must be saved before R is closed if they
  are needed (see \code{dev.copy, jpg} and other graphics device functions)
}
\description{
Initiates a dialog box which provides a GUI to selection of
  stratified samples from 2-D resources.
}
\details{
This routine is intended to be called from the 'SDraw' menu, but it
  can also be called from the command line in non-interactive environments. 
  This routine uses the RGtk2 package windowing capabilities to construct a
  dialog box which pops up on the screen. In the dialog box, users specify at
  least the required input parameters, then press 'Run' to draw the sample.
  
  The requirements parameters are : 
  \enumerate{
      \item Select the 'Sampling Type' (HAL, BAS, GRTS, or SSS) in the top
      drop down list.
      \item Specify the shapefile or 'sp' object that constitutes the sample
      frame, or click 'Browse' to browse for a shapefile (select the .shp
      file when browsing). Shapefiles or sp objects containing points, lines,
      and polygons are allowed. When specifying the name of a shape file
      (actually typing it in the box), do not include the .shp extention and
      recognize that all files associated with the shapefile must reside in
      the current working directory (see \code{getwd}, \code{setwd}). Once
      the frame is specified and before other parameters are specified, the
      user can click the 'Inspect Frame' button to plot the frame and list
      variables associated with objects in the frame.
      \item Specify the name of the stratification variable.  This variable
      must be contained in the data attached to the spatial objects.  For
      example, this could be an elevational class associated with every point
      in the shapefile.  This name is case sensitive and must match that in
      the shapefile or 'sp' object exactly.  Constant values of this variable
      define the strata.
      \item Specify the output object's R name. This output object will be a
      'SpatialPointsDataFrame' (see the 'sp' package) containing the selected
      sample points in HAL, BAS or GRTS order.
      \item Specify the sample size allocation scheme.  Available options are
      the following: 'proportional' to number, length, or size of all objects
      in each strata; 'constant' or same number in all strata; and 'user'
      defined or custom sample Size.  Depending on allocation scheme, the
      meaning of sample size changes.
      \item Specify the sample size.  Interpretation of sample size changes
      based on the allocation scheme.
      \enumerate{
        \item If the allocation scheme is 'proportional', enter one number for
        sample size.  This number of points will be distributed among strata
        based on the relative number of points, length of lines, or area of
        polygons in each strata.
        \item If the allocation scheme is 'constant', enter one number for
        sample size.  This number of points will be selected from each strata. 
        For example, if 50 is specified, 50 points will be selected from
        objecs in each strata.
        \item If the allocation scheme is 'user', enter a list of numbers
        separated by commas.  If there are H strata in the frame, specify H
        numbers (one number per strata).  Order of sample sizes should be same
        as the \code{levels} of the strata variable, as if the stata variable
        were converted to a factor. In fact, to match sample sizes to strata,
        SDraw calls \code{factor} with the strata variable (and uses defaults
        values for other parameters of \code{factor}) and extracts the
        \code{levels} of this factor.  The order of these levels is  the order
        of samples sizes in the list.  For example, if the strata variable
        contains strings "low" and "high", converting this variable to a factor
        generally results in alphabetic  ordering of levels, as in
        \code{c("high", "low")}.  In this case, first number  in the specified
        list should be sample size in the "high" strata, second number should
        be number from the "low" strata, etc. The default ordering of levels
        when vectors are converted to factors is alphabetic, unless global
        options have changed.
      }
    }   
  
  The optional parameters are: 
    \enumerate{
      \item The random number seed.  If the random number seed is specified,
      the same sample is output every time the 'Run' button is pressed.  In
      some cases, it may be important to replicate the sample draw exactly,
      and this is accomplished by specifying the same random number seed. 
      For HAL and BAS samples, the seed must be retained in order to extend
      the number of sampled units in each strata.  Any integer value is
      accpetable as the random number seed.
      \item If the sample type is GRTS, the number of 'over sample
      points' can be specified.  Over sample points are listed at the bottom
      of the output object and can be identified using (output$pointType ==
      "OverSample"), where 'output' is the sample's R name.  Caution should
      be applied when asking for over sample points as spatial balance is
      affected when the oversample is much larger than the intended sample.
      
      Following is a description of the functioning of all buttons at the
      bottom of the dialog:
        \enumerate{
          \item The 'Run' button: After all required and optional inputs are
          specified, the 'Run' button should be pressed and the sample will
          actually be drawn.  Output sample will be placed in a
          \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} in the \code{.GlobalEnv} environment.
          When the sample is complete, a confirmation dialog appears.  Until
          that time, it can appear that R is doing nothing (especially when
          drawing GRTS samples as they can take considerable time, 10's of
          minutes).  Be patient.    
          
          \item The 'Inspect frame' button: After the shapefile or 'sp'
          object name is specified, pressing the 'Inspect Frame' button
          displays a plot of the frame and lists any variables in the data
          associated with each object. After the sample has been drawn, the
          'Inspect Frame' button displays a plot of the study area as well as
          locations of the sample points.

          \item The 'View Sample' button: After the sample has been drawn,
          the 'View Sample' button displays the sample points in a separate
          spreadsheet-like window. No editing is allowed.

          \item The 'Export' button: After the sample has been drawn, the
          'Export' button brings up a save file dialog box which allows the
          user to specify the name of a file to contain the sample.  From
          this dialog box, the sample can be exported in the following
          formats: ArcGIS shapefile (.SHP); Comma Separated (.CSV); Google
          Earth (.KML); and Garmin format (.GPX). Shapefiles actually consist
          of 3 or 4 files. When exporting to a shapefile, do not include the
          .SHP extension in the 'Name' field because the associated files 
          have different extensions.

          \item The 'Done' button: Dismisses the dialog box, leaving the
          sample object in the .GlobalEnv workspace.
