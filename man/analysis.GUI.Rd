\title{Graphic User Interface (GUI) to analyze the status of categorical
or continuous variables collected via GRTS samples.}
\usage{
analysis.GUI()
}
\value{
A data frame with the name specified by the user in the GUI\eqn{'}s 
  \code{Output File} box. This data frame contains the sampling analysis 
  specifications, along with coordinates and projection information. Analysis
  data frames are stored in the current workspace, while any export files, 
  including a \code{txt} log of the commands utilized to generate the sample,
  as well as plots of empirical distribution functions and a \code{csv} of 
  their underlying data, are saved to the file directory specified via 
  \code{getwd}.
}
\description{
Initiates a dialog box via a GUI to analyze samples 
  from 2-D resources.
}
\details{
This routine is intended to be called from the \code{SDrawNPS} menu,
  but it can also be called from the command line in non-interactive 
  environments, such as RStudio. This routine uses the \code{RGtk2} package 
  windowing capabilities to construct a pop-up dialog box, or GUI. In the 
  dialog box, users specify at least the required input parameters, then 
  press the \sQuote{Run} button to analyze the sample.
  
  On submission, the GUI internally packages its inputs, processes the 
  necessary data, and executes the \code{spsurvey}-package 
  \code{cat.analysis} function for the analysis of categorical variables and 
  \code{cont.analysis} function for the same with respect to numeric 
  variables. All \code{SDrawNPS} GUI submissions utilizing the 
  \code{spsurvey} package analysis methodologies lead to the creation of a 
  text-based log file, which records all code utilized. The log file thus 
  serves as a historical record containing analysis information.  It also 
  serves as a tool for enhancing methodological understanding.
  
  See \sQuote{References} for additional resources.

\section{Required Inputs}{

  
  \enumerate{
  
  \item \sQuote{CSV file OR data.frame object} -- Specify the data frame or 
  \code{csv} containing the data for which analysis is required, or click 
  \sQuote{Browse} to browse for a data file with a \code{.csv} extension. 
  When specifying the name of a data file via use of the input box, do not 
  include the \code{.csv} extension.  Following identification of the data, 
  click the \sQuote{Inspect Sample} button to list its variables.
  
  \item \sQuote{Output File} -- Specify the sample\eqn{'}s R object name to which 
  all analysis results will be assigned. The output will be a data frame 
  containing analysis results.
  
  \item \sQuote{Site-ID Variable} -- The case-sensitive variable in the input
  data frame or \code{csv} identifying unique site identifiers.
  
  \item \sQuote{Evaluation Status Variable} -- The case-sensitive variable in
  the input data frame or \code{csv} identifying which sites consitute the 
  surveyed targets.  See \sQuote{Inclusion Identifier.}
  
  \item \sQuote{Inclusion Identifier} -- The case-sensitive text string that 
  identifies surveyed targets of sites in the variable identified via the 
  \sQuote{Evaluation Status Variable} box.
  
  \item \sQuote{Stratum / Subpopulation 1} -- The case-sensitive variable in 
  the input data frame or \code{csv} containing a stratification variable. 
  For example, this could be an elevational class associated with every point
  in the shapefile. Constant values of this variable define the strata.  This
  box can be left blank if analysis requires no consideration of any strata.
  
  \item \sQuote{Stratum / Subpopulation 2} -- Same as \sQuote{Stratum / 
  Subpopuation 1}.
  
  \item \sQuote{Weight Variable} -- The case-sensitive variable in the input 
  data frame or \code{csv} containing the design weights of included sites. 
  Adjustment of included design weights, if appropriate, occurs via the 
  \sQuote{Adjust Weights?} and \sQuote{Population Inference} sections of the 
  GUI.  See \sQuote{Optional Weighting Inputs.}
  
  \item \sQuote{X-Coordinate} -- The case-sensitive variable in the input 
  data frame or \code{csv} containing the \eqn{x}-coordinate of included 
  sites.  Units do not matter.
  
  \item \sQuote{Y-Coordinate} -- The case-sensitive variable in the input 
  data frame or \code{csv} containing the \eqn{y}-coordinate of included 
  sites.  Units do not matter.
  
  \item \sQuote{Outcome(s)} -- The list of case-sensitive variables in the 
  input data frame or \code{csv} for which analysis is required.  Enter 
  multiple variables separated by commas and a space.
  
  \item \sQuote{Confidence Level} -- The confidence level to be utilized in 
  the analysis.
  
  }
}

\section{Optional Weighting Inputs}{

  
  \enumerate{
  
  \item \sQuote{Adjust Weights?} -- When set to \sQuote{Yes}, design weights 
  specified via the \sQuote{Weight Variable} box are adjusted for frame 
  error. See function \code{Adjwgt_FrameNR}. No  adjustment occurs when set 
  to \sQuote{No}.
  
  \item \sQuote{Population Inference} -- Assuming that the \sQuote{Adjust 
  Weights?} radio button is set to \sQuote{Yes}, selection of the 
  \sQuote{Population Inference} radio button specifies the value of the 
  \code{popn} argument in function \code{Adjwgt_FrameNR}. Explicitly, 
  selection of \sQuote{Target} specifies \code{popn="Target"} in 
  \code{Adjwgt_FrameNR}, while selection of \sQuote{Sampled} specifies 
  \code{popn="Sampled"}.
  
  }
}

\section{Dialog Buttons}{

  
  \enumerate{
  
  \item \sQuote{Inspect Sample.} After specifying the \code{csv} file or data
  frame object name, pressing the \sQuote{Inspect Sample} button lists all of
  its constituent variables and vector classes.
  
  \item \sQuote{Run.} After specifying all required and optional inputs, the 
  \sQuote{Run} button analyzes the sample.  The \code{.GlobalEnv} workspace 
  holds the resulting data frame entitled via the name specified in the GUI 
  \sQuote{Output File} box.  A confirmation dialog appears following
  completion of the analysis. 
  
  \item \sQuote{Tabulate Sample.} Following analysis, display the GRTS 
  analysis file in a tabular format.  The GRTS analysis file contains 
  information on each sampled unit, such as coordinates, and design 
  variables, e.g., stratum or multi-density category.  It also contains 
  possibly adjusted design weights.
  
  \item \sQuote{Done.} Dismisses the GUI dialog box, leaving any analysis 
  objects in the \code{.GlobalEnv} workspace.
