\title{Selection of spatially balanced samples.}

\description{
SDrawNPS is a GUI interface to a set of R functions that draw Generalized-Random-Tesselation-Stratified (GRTS) samples. Input sampling frames can be points (0-D, finite), lines (1-D, infinite), or polygons (2-D, infinite), and can be contained in ESRI shapefiles (SHP), Google Earth files (KML), Garmin files (GPX), or CSV files.  Functionality to visualize the frame and sample is included.

}
When SDrawNPS is attached (via \code{library(SDrawNPS)}, a new menu item appears in the (Windows) R interface.  This menu ('SDrawNPS') contains items which call dialog boxes, or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that implement the interface to functions that actually do the work of drawing and analyzing samples.   

The function that actually draws the samples is \code{grts} (for GRTS samples), while the functions that analyzes samples are \code{cat.analysis} and \code{cont.analysis}.  All three are taken straight from package \code{spsurvey}.  The main purpose of SDrawNPS is to provide a simple-to-use interface to these routines.  These routines, however, could be called directly in code if needed.  

GRTS samples can be drawn from resources having at most 2 dimensions.  

The general work flow for drawing a sample from a 2-dimensional resource is as follows:
\tabular{ll}{
1: \tab Open the appropriate item under the SDrawNPS menu (or execute the appropriate GUI function, e.g., \code{equi.GUI()});\cr
2: \tab Select GRTS as the sampling algorithm (GRTS);\cr
3: \tab Input appropriate parameters for the sampling of interest;\cr
4: \tab Browse for a shapefile containing a 2-D polygon of the study area;\cr
5: \tab Hit 'Run'.\cr
}

\author{
Trent McDonald \code{tmcdonald@west-inc.com}, Jason Mitchell, Guy DiDonato, and David Russo wrote the GUI interfaces. Leigh Ann Starcevich wrote the design-weight adjustment routine.  

The GRTS routine comes from package \code{spsurvey}, as do the routines associated with sampling analysis.  All the difficult routines of the GUI interface are in \code{RGtk2}, while routines to handle spatial 
objects are in package \code{sp} and \code{rgdal}.
