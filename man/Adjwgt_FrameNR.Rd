\title{Adjust design weights for frame error.}
\usage{
Adjwgt_FrameNR(dat, popn, evalstatus = "EvalStatus", wgt = "wgt")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A GRTS-design \code{csv} file generated from a GRTS sample draw, 
with individual sites forming its rows.}

\item{popn}{A text string identifying the type of membership of a site.  Use 
\code{popn="Target"} if the site is not needed, or \code{popn="Sampled"} 
for scope of inference.  (what does this mean?)}

\item{evalstatus}{A text string identifying the variable within \code{dat} 
describing the evaluation status of sites in \code{dat}.  See
\sQuote{Variable \code{evalstatus} Specifications.}}

\item{wgt}{A text string identifying the variable within \code{dat} 
containing site-specific design weights.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector \code{adj.wt} of length equal to the number-of-site
  rows originally contained in \code{dat}.  Right???
}
\description{
Takes data for a single survey year (why does a year matter) and
  calculates site-specific design weights after accounting for frame error and
  nonresponse, while assuming missing-completely-at-random missingness.
}
\details{
This routine is called by the sampling analysis Graphical User 
  Interface (GUI), i.e., function \code{analysis.GUI}, when its
  \sQuote{Optional Weight Inputs} \sQuote{Adjust Weights?} radio button is
  set to \sQuote{Yes.}  See \code{analysis.GUI}. Generally, this function is
  not intended to be called directly by the user.
  
  When the \code{analysis.GUI} requests adjustment of weights, function 
  \code{Adjwgt_FrameNR} modifies the included weights \code{wgt} in 
  \code{dat} for frame error and nonresponse.  The methodology assumes any 
  missing (sites??? -- should these be set to evalstatus="something"??) are
  missing completely at random.
  
  What happens if the data cover more than a year?  Does the code break?  Should 
  the user manipulate the data somehow to account for this?  Does the function
  assume non-temporal variability?
}
\section{Variable \code{evalstatus} Specifications}{

  
  Each row of \code{dat} represents a randomly selected site from the GRTS 
  sample draw. Generally, \code{dat} contains additional variables for data 
  collected during the survey. Essentially however, \code{dat} must contain a
  field \code{evalstatus} that describes the sampling nature of all sampled 
  sites.  Valid values include: (what happens if a value is not one of these
  4???)
  
  \enumerate{
  
  \item \code{"Target - Sampled"} -- The site is a member of the target
  population and data were successfully collected.
  
  \item \code{"Target - Not Sampled"} -- The site is a member of the target
  population, but data were not collected, e.g., due to innaccessibility, 
  landowner denial, etc.
  
  \item{"Not Evaluated"} -- The site was not assessed by observer crews.
  
  \item{"Non-Target"} -- The site is not a member of the target population.
  
  }

\examples{
# Do we want to put anything here?  If so, what might it be?  It should use 
# a dat from a csv included in the package.
stratified.GUI() # change me change me change me
