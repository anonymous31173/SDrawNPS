\title{Adjust design weights for frame error.}
\usage{
Adjwgt_FrameNR(dat, popn, evalstatus = "EvalStatus", wgt = "wgt")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A GRTS-design \code{csv} file generated from a GRTS sample draw, 
with individual sites forming its rows.}

\item{popn}{A text string identifying the type of membership of a site.  Use 
\code{popn="Target"} if the site is not needed, or \code{popn="Sampled"} 
for scope of inference.}

\item{evalstatus}{A text string identifying the variable within \code{dat} 
describing the evaluation status of sites in \code{dat}.  See 
\sQuote{\code{evalstatus} Variable Specifications.}}

\item{wgt}{A text string identifying the variable within \code{dat} 
containing site-specific design weights.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector \code{adj.wt} of length equal to the number-of-site
  rows originally contained in \code{dat}.
}
\description{
Takes data for a single survey year and calculates site-specific
  design weights after accounting for frame error and nonresponse, while 
  assuming missing-completely-at-random missingness.
}
\details{
This routine is called by the sampling analysis Graphical User 
  Interface (GUI), i.e., function \code{analysis.GUI}, when its 
  \sQuote{Optional Weight Inputs} \sQuote{Adjust Weights?} radio button is 
  set to \sQuote{Yes.}  See \code{analysis.GUI}. Generally, this function is 
  not intended to be called directly by the user.
  
  When the \code{analysis.GUI} routine requests adjustment of weights,
  function \code{Adjwgt_FrameNR} modifies the included weights \code{wgt} in 
  \code{dat} for frame error and nonresponse.  The methodology assumes any 
  missing sites are missing completely at random.  Weighting adjustment is
  appropriate for a single survey period (e.g. season or year) and does not
  accommodate weighting for summary statistics of more than one survey
  period.
}
\section{\code{evalstatus} Variable Specifications}{

  
  Each row of \code{dat} represents a randomly selected site from the GRTS 
  sample draw. Generally, \code{dat} contains additional variables for data 
  collected during the survey. Essentially however, \code{dat} must contain a
  field \code{evalstatus} that describes the sampling nature of all sampled 
  sites.  An error is returned if the \code{evalstatus} variable is not 
  formatted to be one of the following four values:
  
  \enumerate{
  
  \item \code{"Target - Sampled"} -- The site is a member of the target 
  population and data were successfully collected.
  
  \item \code{"Target - Not Sampled"} -- The site is a member of the target 
  population, but data were not collected, e.g., due to innaccessibility, 
  landowner denial, etc.
  
  \item \code{"Not Evaluated"} -- The site was not assessed by observer
  crews.
  
  \item \code{"Non-Target"} -- The site is not a member of the target
  population.
  
  }
